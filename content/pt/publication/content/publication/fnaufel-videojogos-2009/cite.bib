 abstract = {This paper proposes the creation of
a simple architecture to separate programming tasks
from resource allocation tasks. It demonstrates the
integration of a knowledge base modeled in DL
(Description Logic) with the XNA Game Engine, using
the OwlDotNetApi library. The main goal is to
demonstrate a trivial use case of ontologies in the
domain of games. We have implemented a 2D adventure
game using this technique, which we then compare
with classical methods of development.},
