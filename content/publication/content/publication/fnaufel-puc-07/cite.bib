 abstract = {Description Logics is a family of formalisms used to represent knowledge of a domain. In contrast with others knowledge representation systems, Description Logics are equipped with a formal, logic-based semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on description logics provide various inference capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge. We present a sequent calculus for ALC, a basic Description Logic. The first motivation  for developing such a system is the extraction of computational content of ALC proofs. The present calculus is an intermediate step towards a Natural Deduction System for ALC.},
