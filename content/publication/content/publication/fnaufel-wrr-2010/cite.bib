  abstract = {The development and use of ontologies may require users with no training in formal logic to handle complex concept descriptions. To aid such users, we propose a new visualization framework called “model outlines”, where more emphasis is placed on the semantics of concept descriptions than on their syntax. We have conducted a usability study comparing model outlines and Manchester OWL, with results that indicate the potential benefits of our visual language for understanding concept descriptions.}
