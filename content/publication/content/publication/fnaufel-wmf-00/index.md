abstract: "This paper discusses how RETOOL, an action logic featuring an operator that expresses necessary conditions, postconditions and time bounds of actions, can be combined with MTL, a linear-time temporal logic with time-bounded operators, to reason about general properties of timed transition systems, an abstract model for the behavior of objects in a real-time, object-oriented software system."
