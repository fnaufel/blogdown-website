abstract: "This paper proposes the creation of a simple architecture to separate programming tasks from resource allocation tasks. It demonstrates the integration of a knowledge base modeled in DL (Description Logic) with the XNA Game Engine, using the OwlDotNetApi library. The main goal is to demonstrate a trivial use case of ontologies in the domain of games. We have implemented a 2D adventure game using this technique, which we then compare with classical methods of development."
