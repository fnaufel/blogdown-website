abstract: "Well-integrated development tools, allowing automatic code generation from visual representations of analysis and design decisions, are important assets in handling the complexities of today's software. This paper describes several message passing semantics for the expression of concurrency in a new object-oriented visual development system, along with the C$^++$ idioms generated for asynchronous messages."
