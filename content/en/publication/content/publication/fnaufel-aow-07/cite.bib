 abstract = {We present the structure of an ontology for Information Security (IS), applied to the extraction of knowledge from Natural Language texts (IS standards, security policies and security control descriptions). This ontology is composed of the vocabulary for the IS Domain, and a particular kind of ontology description, logical forms to determine the structure of the DL formulas associated with the texts.  We also discuss the relationship between the structure of the formulas and the efficiency of the reasoner.},
