 abstract = {This dissertation defines RETOOL, an action logic featuring an operator to denote necessary conditions and postconditions of actions in a timed transition system (an extension of the formalism of transition systems meant to model real-time reactive/concurrent computational systems). A semantics for RETOOL is presented and compared to previous proposals. An adequate axiomatization is given, along with detailed correctness and weak completeness proofs.},
