 abstract = {This paper defines an action logic featuring an operator that denotes necessary conditions and postconditions of actions in a timed computational transition system. Three different semantics of the operator are discussed, and weak completeness is proved for one of them. It is also briefly shown how the action logic can be combined with a temporal logic to derive temporal properties of actions from the logical description of a real-time computational system.},
