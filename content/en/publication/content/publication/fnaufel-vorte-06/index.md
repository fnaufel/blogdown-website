abstract: "We present the structure of an ontology for Information Security (IS) and discuss a paradigm whereby it can be used to extract knowledge from natural language texts such as IS standards, security policies and security control descriptions. Besides providing a vocabulary for the IS domain, the proposed ontology stores logical forms corresponding to statements in the text, as well as a set of axioms used for inference in description logic (DL). We also describe a tool to provide automatic support for the formalization process."
